Welcome to Cocktail, please!

This is an app for the indecisive drinkers out there looking for a little alcoholic inspiration. I wanted a simple website that provided a random cocktail by simply pressing the "Cocktail, please!" button. Over time I added functions to search by cocktail name and cocktail ingredient. It also allows a user to create a unique profile and save cocktails for future evenings (or afternoons, I don't judge).

This app is built using Python, Flask, SQL-alchemy, jinja, and the free cocktail database API, found at https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php.
